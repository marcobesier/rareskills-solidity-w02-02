# What might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?
1. To have an efficient way to migrate the community of an NFT project to a "fork" (see the [wrapped penguins story](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/pudgy-penguins-nft-project-ousts-founders-as-mood-turns-icy/)).
2. To be able to sell ownership while the actual NFT is staked in some protocol without the need to unstake it for the transfer of ownership.
3. To have a mechanism for receipt tokens. This can, for example, be used to determine the ratio of "investment" that a particular user has in a protocol. While this can, of course, also be tracked directly inside the protocol, it might make more sense in some cases to work with receipt tokens instead.
4. As a way to upgrade the NFT collection's functionality.
